  <h2><mat-icon>help_outline</mat-icon> How it works</h2>
  <p>
    Release Butler has a list of GitHub open source projects he is interested in
    like Angular, React, Typescript, RxJs or many others... He checks their
    repositories <strong>every half hour</strong> to figure out if somebody
    created a new release. If yes, Release Butler grabs corresponding changelog,
    makes it beautiful and posts it on Twitterâ€¦
  </p>

  <h2><mat-icon>check_circle_outline</mat-icon> Goals</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Reduce repetitive workflow</strong> when you had to manually check
      GitHub repositories for the new versions and changelogs of used libraries
    </li>
    <li>
      Decrease nagging FOMO when you didnâ€™t check Twitter for a whole day and
      fear that you may have <strong>missed a release announcement</strong> by
      the author of the library youâ€™re interested in
    </li>
    <li>
      Empower developers by providing them with a tool that enables them to
      <strong>generate beautifully looking changelogs</strong> which can be
      usedS in their blog posts, presentations or just to share with other peeps
    </li>
    <li>
      Ability to fill the role of the person who breaks the news to the rest of
      the team is optional ðŸ˜‰
    </li>
  </ol>

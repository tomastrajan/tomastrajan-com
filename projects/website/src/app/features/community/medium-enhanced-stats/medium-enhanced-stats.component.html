    is a Chrome extension which gives your total reach and summary stats of your
    articles (and responses) with a single click without need to visit Medium
    itself!

    Besides that it also adds lots of useful improvements and information to the
    original Medium stats page!

  <h2><mat-icon>favorite_border</mat-icon> Motivation</h2>
  <blockquote>
    I have been using Medium for years and I was always curious about the total
    reach of my articles
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, Medium stats can be described only as very basic. Even simple
    stuff like a summary row with a total count of the views and reads at the
    bottom of the table is unfortunately missing...
  </p>
  <p>
    The only solution was to add up the numbers manually which is a boring,
    error-prone process. It gets progressively more tedious with the increasing
    number of articles, so you basically get punished for being a productive
    writerâ€¦
